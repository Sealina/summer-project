              <h1>About Me</h1>
            <p>
             Selina is a San Francisco native who has lived in the city her entire life. She began her academic journey at City College of San Francisco and later transferred to San Francisco State University, where she is currently in her second semester majoring in Visual Communication.
             <br><br>
             Art has always been a significant part of her life, even though she didnâ€™t grow up in a household that was heavily involved in the arts. Raised in a traditional Chinese family where creative careers were not strongly encouraged, she often felt that her passion for art was misunderstood. Still, she has continued to pursue her dream of working in a creative field, driven by a deep love for visual expression and design.
             <br><br>
             She is familiar with design and development tools such as Figma, Photoshop, Illustrator, InDesign, Python, and Java, and she is constantly working to grow her skills. In her free time, she enjoys drawing, painting, and playing video games with friends. She also occasionally spends time baking and cooking.
             <br><br>
             Currently, she is excited to learn more about the skills required to become a UX/UI designer and looks forward to seeing where this creative journey will lead her.
